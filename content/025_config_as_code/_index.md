title: "11. Configuration As Code"
chapter: false
weight: 25

You can implement configuration values for your apps and microservices in environment variables, mounted volumes, or behind other services.
Configuration as Code (CaC) is the philosophy which starts with moving configuration values out of the container images.
As a best practice, you should consider going further.
You can pull your configuration values out of the pod specification itself.
Where should your configuration values go?
There's a kind of Kubernetes object for that!

## ConfigMap objects

A [`ConfigMap`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) is a kind of Kubernetes resource that implements as **key-value** store, like many other configuration file and key-value database technologies.
The values in a `ConfigMap` can be simple values or complicated structures of values.

Let's start simple. 

{{< step >}}Make a `ConfigMap` which encapsulates an intended value for your `GREETING` environment variable.{{< /step >}}

```yaml
cat <<EOF | tee ~/environment/007-greeting-configmap.yaml | kubectl -n dev apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: greeting
data:
  greeting: Bonjour de
EOF
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
configmap/greeting created
{{< /output >}}

## Mapped Environment Variables

You can refer to `ConfigMap` resources within other Kubernetes resources. 
For example, you can change your `Pod` spec to [pull the value of a container's environment variables from a `ConfigMap`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#define-container-environment-variables-using-configmap-data).
Do that now.  

{{< step >}}Create this new version of your deployment manifest with the `configMapKeyRef` section as follows.{{< /step >}}
```yaml
cat <<EOF | tee ~/environment/008-demo-deployment.yaml | kubectl -n dev apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: demo
  name: demo
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: demo
        image: demo:1.0.0
        env:
        - name: GREETING         # the overridden environment variable
          valueFrom:             # not just value: directly here but valueFrom: as a reference
            configMapKeyRef:     # a ConfigMap is the source of the data
              name: greeting     # the name of the ConfigMap
              key: greeting      # the key within the data section of that ConfigMap
EOF
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
deployment.apps/demo configured
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}`exec` into your new pod to test it from inside as follows.{{< /step >}}
```bash
kubectl -n dev exec deployment/demo -it -- curl http://localhost:80
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
Bonjour de demo-7d747c9f5c-2qnbt
{{< /output >}}

## Check when a container picks up changes

If you change a value in a `ConfigMap`, does the container in your pod automatically receive the change? 

{{< step >}}To find out, change the value in the configmap:{{< /step >}}

```yaml
cat <<EOF | tee ~/environment/009-greeting-configmap.yaml | kubectl -n dev apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: greeting
data:
  greeting: Hallo aus
EOF
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
configmap/greeting configured
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}Confirm the change is in your "greeting" `ConfigMap`:{{< /step >}}
```bash
kubectl -n dev describe configmap greeting
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
Name:         greeting
Namespace:    dev
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Data
====
greeting:
----
Hallo aus
...
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}Run the web query to see the current value in the running container:{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl -n dev exec deployment/demo -it -- curl http://localhost:80
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
Bonjour de demo-7d747c9f5c-2qnbt
{{< /output >}}

This is the *old* value you had assigned previously. Why? 

{{% notice note %}}
In *processes*, and therefore the *containers* that contain them, values of environment variables ***bind*** (are assigned) their values at process start time.
Because the pod's container was not restarted it is still running with the old value.
{{% /notice %}}

{{< step >}}Restart your pod.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl -n dev rollout restart deployment demo
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
deployment.apps/demo restarted
{{< /output >}}

{{% notice note %}}
It was mentioned in the previous chapter that **deployments** were more "functional and forgiving" than podspecs.
Right here is a good example.
You may recall previously using `kubectl -n dev exec demo -it -- kill 1` to **force** a restart.
Sure it works, but it was a little heavy handed compared to what we have just done.
{{% /notice %}}

{{< step >}}Now that the container has restarted, check if it picked up the new value from the `ConfigMap`.{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl -n dev exec deployment/demo -it -- curl http://localhost:80
```

{{< output >}}
Hallo aus demo-574c779fb8-t7rmq
{{< /output >}}

So a process does not pick up new environment variable values until it is restarted.
Restarted deployments will cause running pods to be replaced with new pods with newly generated names.
Restart pods to force them to consume revised environment variable values, including those sourced from a `ConfigMap`.

## Consuming ConfigMaps as volumes

Environment variables are just one of the ways you can use `ConfigMap` values.
Another way that values from a `ConfigMap` can be accessed from a pod is by referencing the `ConfigMap` as a `volume`.

{{< step >}}Create "quotes" as follows, which give us an opportunity to try a different flavor of `ConfigMap`:{{< /step >}}

```yaml
cat <<EOF | tee ~/environment/010-quotes-configmap.yaml | kubectl -n dev apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: quotes
data:
data:
  daisy-bell.txt: |
    Daisy, Daisy,
    Give me your answer, do!
    I'm half crazy,
    All for the love of you!
    It won't be a stylish marriage,
    I can't afford a carriage,
    But you'll look sweet on the seat
    Of a bicycle built for two!
  hamlet-nutshell.txt: >
    "O God, 
    I could be bound in a nutshell, 
    and count myself a king of infinite space – 
    were it not that I have bad dreams."
    - William Shakespeare, Hamlet
EOF
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
configmap/quotes created
{{< /output >}}

Take note of the two ***keys*** in the `data` section:
- `daisy-bell.txt` looks like a file name, but is simply a key in this map like any other
- `hamlet-nutshell.txt` is also in classic UNIX filename style

Each of these keys has a multi-line value.
Why is the punctuation different after the colon and before those value lines?
We'll refer back this source YAML later and look at the effects of the `|` used with `dasiy-bell.txt` and the `>` used with `hamlet-nutshell.txt`.

{{< step >}}Get a list of the current `ConfigMap` objects in the `dev` Kubernetes namespace:{{< /step >}}
```bash
kubectl -n dev get configmaps
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
NAME               DATA   AGE
greeting           4      13h
kube-root-ca.crt   1      16h
quotes             2      2m8s
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}Witness how Kubernetes has formatted and stored those two quotes:{{< /step >}}

```bash
kubectl -n dev get configmaps quotes -o yaml
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
apiVersion: v1
data:
  daisy-bell.txt: |
    Daisy, Daisy,
    Give me your answer, do!
    I'm half crazy,
    All for the love of you!
    It won't be a stylish marriage,
    I can't afford a carriage,
    But you'll look sweet on the seat
    Of a bicycle built for two!
  hamlet-nutshell.txt: |
    "O God,  I could be bound in a nutshell,  and count myself a king of infinite space –  were it not that I have bad dreams." - William Shakespeare, Hamlet
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
...
{{< /output >}}

Recall that the source YAML in the Kubernetes manifest for this "quotes" `ConfigMap` used different punctuation for the two values in the `data` section:
- `|` before the value lines ***retains*** the vertical spacing of the newlines.
Preserving newlines is important in many configuration files and data files used by your app software, add-on daemons, and operating system components.
- `>` before the value lines ***folds*** the newlines into spaces.
This makes the data value all a one line character string.
This is useful when you simply need the string value, but don't care about preserving newlines.
The choice of which notation you use depends largely on the needs of the software or humans consuming those values.

Now for the ***fun*** part.
You can create `volumes` in your pods which refer to ConfigMaps.
You can then mount any of those volumes from within any of the pod's containers where it will present itself as a file.
The power of this should not be underestimated.
Not only can you map *arguments* and *environment variables* into your running containers, but you can map `ConfigMap` data as files into your containers.
Think about that for a moment.
You do not have to build new container *images* when you simply want containers to use different files.
These files could be data files, configuration files, localization resources, et cetera.
Let's note in passing that a `ConfigMap` can support a `binaryData` section as well as the regular `data` section you have seen.
How do you want to get those beautiful `png` graphic images into your pods? More on that later.
For now, let's simply mount a volume with some simple text files.

{{< step >}}Create yet another version of your deployment manifest, this one with both the `env` reference, and now adding a `volumeMounts` to the newer configmap.{{< /step >}}
```yaml
cat <<EOF | tee ~/environment/011-demo-deployment.yaml | kubectl -n dev apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: demo
  name: demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo
    spec:
      volumes:                   # a pod CAN contain multiple volumes, but this on has only one
      - name: quotes-volume      # the name of this volume is used to refer to it - e.g. in a "mount"
        configMap:               # specify the type of volume this is - we're referring to a ConfigMap
          name: quotes           # the name of the ConfigMap this volume refers to
      containers:
      - name: demo
        image: demo:1.0.0
        env:                     # "env" section as before
        - name: GREETING
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: greeting
              key: greeting
        volumeMounts:            # the "volumeMounts" in a given container are declared parallel to "env"
        - name: quotes-volume    # the name of the volume you want to mount, from the pod's "volumes" section
          mountPath: /var/quotes # the container filesystem namespace path - refer to this *inside* the container
EOF
```

Example output:
{{< output >}}
deployment.apps/demo configured
{{< /output >}}

{{< step >}}`exec` into your new pod and list the files in `/var/quotes`.{{< /step >}}
```bash
kubectl -n dev exec deployment/demo -it -- ls /var/quotes
```

{{< step >}}Now see what that `daisy-bell.txt` file looks like inside the container.{{< /step >}}
```bash
kubectl -n dev exec deployment/demo -it -- cat /var/quotes/daisy-bell.txt
```

{{< step >}}Remember that you used `>` to fold the lines of the Hamlet quote. Take a look at the result.{{< /step >}}
```bash
kubectl -n dev exec deployment/demo -it -- cat /var/quotes/hamlet-nutshell.txt
```

{{% notice note %}}
In both cases, what happened to the indentation in your original Kubernetes manifest for the "quotes" `ConfigMap`?
While the `|` and `>` **retain** and **fold** the newlines in the content respectively, both of these multi-line value notations in YAML strip the indentation of those lines of data, according to the indentation of the element.
This will be significant not only for your Kubernetes manifests you write from scratch, but any you automatically generate, and any Kubernetes manifests you author via tools such as the package management tool `helm`.

## ConfigMaps are namespace scoped

Before we move on, reflect upon why this separation of code from config is desirable.

Your namespaces could be used to represent different environments (e.g. `dev` or `test`) and the apps which run there would, for example, connect to environment-specific database instances.
When you bind a configmap to a pod's container it will seek a named object (e.g. `connection-strings`) located in its **own** namespace since it has no further visibility.
This means **identical** pod definitions, deployed to separate namespaces, could bind to configmaps of the same name but with environment specific contents.

## Success

In this lesson, you:
- Created a `ConfigMap` and populated it with data.
- Changed the direct value in the `env` section of a `Pod`'s container to use a *reference* to your `ConfigMap`.
- Reprovisioned the pod with this new definition.
- Confirmed that the value from the `ConfigMap` appears in the pod.
- Made changes to the `ConfigMap` and showed that they do not appear in the pod.
- Restarted the pod to get the new value to be used.
- Observed how it is possible to use `volumes` to consume `ConfigMaps` as files.
- Considered the use of like-named `ConfigMaps` across differing namespaces.
